# ðŸ›° GoIT DE Homework 5 â€” Apache Kafka IoT Monitoring

## ðŸ“˜ Task Overview

This project simulates a real-time IoT monitoring system using **Apache Kafka** and **Python**. It includes sensor data generation, stream processing, filtering, and alert handling.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- **Sensor producer** â†’ sends temperature and humidity data to Kafka.
- **Alert processor** â†’ reads the data and sends alerts based on thresholds.
- **Alert listener** â†’ reads alerts from alert topics and prints them.

---

## ðŸ§© Kafka Topics

Created via `create_topics.py`:

- `building_sensors_serhii_mishovych`
- `temperature_alerts_serhii_mishovych`
- `humidity_alerts_serhii_mishovych`

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

> Requires Docker and WSL with Python

1. **Start Kafka**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. **Create topics:**:
   ```bash
   python create_topics.py
   ```
3. **Simulate sensors (in multiple terminals):**:
   ```bash
   python sensor_producer.py
   ```
4. **Process alerts:**:
   ```bash
   python sensor_alert_processor.py
   ```
5. **Display alerts:**:
   ```bash
   python alert_listener.py
   ```
